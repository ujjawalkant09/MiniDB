Learning how to build a database from scratch

Lateley I have been learning about databases and how they work, and I decided to build a simple database from scratch.

Obiously taking helps from gemini and other LLM and trying to understand why and how databases work.


Most of thing right now I also don't understand and trying to figure out how to make it work.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to ask.
